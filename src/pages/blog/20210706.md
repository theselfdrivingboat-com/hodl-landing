One of the most useful feedback we got from last week was from a pioneer that told us **your updates should not be a shopping list, should be what is the most important thing you got done this week in 200 characters**. Really true! 

### Next Milestone

Have boat permanently and reliably in the seaA

### Goals For This Week


- **how much energy takes for boat to keep position in the sea?** answer this question is the goal of this week. Keeping the boat NOT in the sea is complex and requires money, and our short term goal is to have the boat permanently in the sea
- **does new wave resistant ball structure work?** we need to build the boat keeping in mind that it will flip because of big waves, even if left for one night. That's why we need ASAP a new design for how to keep the electronic, this new idea of having a buoy might be the winning one. We need to know if there are unexpected blockers, and prove that it works
- **what is the real 4G internet coverage?** we are not using starlink in the near future, what is the real 4G range that the boat can have with the new router with antennas?


# What are you building, in a sentence?

**Carbon free computing on solar powered boats**

# What did you accomplish this week? Did you do everything you planned?


# What do you want to have done by the end of next week?
